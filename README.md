## Project Background & Motivation

Financial institutions must balance accuracy in pricing loans with the need for transparency. Traditional risk models are giving way to machine learning algorithms that are highly predictive yet often work as ‚Äúblack boxes.‚Äù This project addresses these challenges by comparing diverse modeling techniques on both raw and engineered data while integrating explainability methods.

---

## Problem Statement

The challenge is to predict interest rates accurately while making the decision-making process interpretable for regulatory and financial transparency. This project tackles that by combining model performance with explainable AI.

---

## Objectives

* Collect and preprocess a decade-long dataset of loan applications.
* Build and evaluate ML models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and FNN.
* Apply feature selection (LassoCV, XGBoost importance).
* Integrate SHAP for global/local interpretability.
* Assess trade-offs using RMSE, MAE, R¬≤.
* Create deployment-ready app with UI and backend support.

---

## Impact

* Enhances interest rate forecasting accuracy and fairness.
* Builds trust through transparent explainability (SHAP).
* Enables deployment of ML solutions in production-grade environments.
* Useful for risk analysts, regulators, and business teams.

---

## Key Contributions

* üîç Dual-dataset analysis: raw vs engineered feature impact

## Trade-offs and Improvements

* Accuracy vs interpretability clearly outlined
* Future enhancements include:
  * Hybrid/distilled models
  * Real-time dashboards for SHAP
  * Expanded use cases for loan types

---

## Deployment Strategy

### ‚úÖ Current: Streamlit Application

* Built with Streamlit for rapid UI + SHAP visualization
* Deployed via Render or Streamlit Cloud
* User inputs, prediction output, and explainability on one screen

---

## Further Improvements & Recommendations

* Integrate SHAP dashboard for stakeholder interactivity
* Monitor for data/model drift
* Test alternate modeling frameworks (e.g., LightGBM, CatBoost)
* Build CI/CD pipelines with Docker & unit tests
